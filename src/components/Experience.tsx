              Although my work in this company was mainly in a business facing
              the public, I was able to learn many things related to the
              maintenance of a store, the situation of the shop windows, prices,
              stock control, as well as incidents with clients in relation to to
              the products that were sold.
            </p>
            <p className="p-4">
              However, my specialty was the appraisal of products and their
              subsequent full functionality testing (which had to be done to
              guarantee the quality of the product before proceeding with its
              purchase).

              It was also a dream come true for me to be able to be surrounded
